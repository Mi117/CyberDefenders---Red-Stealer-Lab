# CyberDefenders---Red-Stealer-Lab
CyberDefenders — Red Stealer Lab Walkthrough

INTRO:

This repository contains my solution to the RedLine Stealer challenge, a comprehensive exercise in malware analysis and incident response. The scenario involves investigating a suspicious executable file discovered on a colleague's computer, suspected to be linked to a Command and Control (C2) server. The goal is to analyze the malware's behavior, identify key indicators of compromise (IOCs), and gather insights beneficial for the Security Operations Center (SOC) and Incident Response teams.

PLATFORMS / TOOLS USED:

- VIRUS TOTAL [https://www.virustotal.com/gui/]: for identifying details about the malware, by submitting the file(s) hashes to get comprehensive scan results and analysis.
- THREATFOX [https://threatfox.abuse.ch/]: a project by Abuse.ch, is a threat intelligence platform that specializes in the collection and sharing of indicators of compromise (IoCs) related to malware and cyber threats.
  
SCENARIO:

You are part of the Threat Intelligence team in the SOC (Security Operations Center). An executable file has been discovered on a colleague's computer, and it's suspected to be linked to a Command and Control (C2) server, indicating a potential malware infection.
Your task is to investigate this executable by analyzing its hash. The goal is to gather and analyze data beneficial to other SOC members, including the Incident Response team, to respond to this suspicious behavior efficiently.

WALKTHORUGH:

Q1) Categorizing malware enables a quicker and easier understanding of its distinct behaviors and attack vectors. What is the category of the identified malware?
Jumping into Virus Total and analyzing the HASH provided in the .txt file, we can identify the malware as a TROJAN.

Q2) Clearly identifying the name of the malware file improves communication among the SOC team. What is the file name associated with this malware?
Navigate into the Details section to find the name of the file in the "Names" section.
The answer is wextract

Q3) Knowing the exact timestamp of when the malware was first observed can help prioritize response actions. Newly detected malware may require urgent containment and eradication compared to older, well-documented threats. What is the UTC timestamp of the malware's first submission to VirusTotal?

Knowing the timestamps is critical when analyzing malwares, grealty improving and helping Blue team to:
- Prioritization of Response Actions: Newly detected malware may indicate an active threat, requiring urgent containment and eradication compared to older, well-documented threats. This helps allocate resources efficiently to mitigate potential damage.

- Forensic Investigations: Timestamps provide a chronological sequence of events, aiding investigators in tracing the origin and progression of an attack. This can reveal the attacker’s methods, extent of the breach, and assist in preventing future incidents.

- Detection of Anti-Forensic Techniques: Threat actors may use tactics like timestomping to manipulate timestamps and obscure their activities. Accurate timestamp analysis can help identify such anomalies and uncover hidden malicious actions.

- System Integrity Checks: By comparing file timestamps with known baselines, cybersecurity systems can detect unauthorized changes, highlighting potential compromises or malware activity.

-Threat Intelligence and Updates: Timestamp data supports the development of timely antivirus updates and threat intelligence by identifying when a malware strain was first active, enabling rapid countermeasures

We can find the answer in the section right above "Names" as shown in the photo.

Q4) Understanding the techniques used by malware helps in strategic security planning. What is the MITRE ATT&CK technique ID for the malware's data collection from the system before exfiltration?

Let's jump into the Behaviour section of our Virus Total analysis > then MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques.
Looking at the option "Collection" we can the see the Mitre code for it as T1005 - the malware file applaunch.exe searched for sensitive data of the web browser.

![q4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a1a1513-e950-42f2-9b4e-671668541723)

Q5) Following execution, which social media-related domain names did the malware resolve via DNS queries?

We can get the answer by looking at the HTTP requests and IP traffic, which points clearly to our answer: facebook.com

![q5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6681e55b-04a4-4160-b959-f346b99b8b51)

Q6) Once the malicious IP addresses are identified, network security devices such as firewalls can be configured to block traffic to and from these addresses. Can you provide the IP address and destination port the malware communicates with?

The correct answer is http://77.91.124.55:19071 because it represents the Command and Control (C2) server used by the malware for communication. Malware often establishes connections with C2 servers to receive commands, exfiltrate data, or download additional payloads. In this case, the IP address and port combination (77.91.124.55:19071) indicates a specific endpoint used by the malware for such purposes, aligning with typical C2 behavior described in threat analysis reports - also shown in the photo.

Q7) YARA rules are designed to identify specific malware patterns and behaviors. What's the name of the YARA rule created by "Varp0s" that detects the identified malware?

Running a search on your preferred browser with the parameters "Yara Rules" "Varp0s" will give you the answer

![q7-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adb6875e-2f92-4829-84a0-7172e4f57588)
![q7-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/965b87c5-f2d8-4253-89bd-f5c7da5e37f6)

The rule name is detect_Redline_Stealer

Q8) Understanding which malware families are targeting the organization helps in strategic security planning for the future and prioritizing resources based on the threat. Can you provide the different malware alias associated with the malicious IP address according to ThreatFox?

To find the malware associated with the malicious IP address we then use ThreatFox platform, provided by abuse.ch .
1. Visit the ThreatFox website: https://threatfox.abuse.ch.
2. You can use the search functionality to look up the specific malicious IP address (e.g., 77.91.124.55) or IP:port combination (e.g., 77.91.124.55:19071).
3. ThreatFox will display detailed information, including malware aliases, associated threat types, and other indicators of compromise (IOCs).

Q9) By identifying the malware's imported DLLs, we can configure security tools to monitor for the loading or unusual usage of these specific DLLs. Can you provide the DLL utilized by the malware for privilege escalation?

You can find the answer in the Details > Imports section: ADVAPI32.dll is the correct answer  because it is a system DLL that is commonly targeted for privilege escalation attacks as is a crucial system library used for various Windows operations, including security and registry management. Malware often targets such libraries to gain elevated privileges (DLL hijacking).
